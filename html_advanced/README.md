# HTML Structure README

This README provides an overview of the HTML structure for the project.

## Introduction

In this project, we focus on creating the HTML structure using semantic markup. The goal is to build a webpage based on the provided wireframe without any CSS or styling. This allows us to establish a solid foundation with clean and meaningful HTML before applying visual design.

## Repository Structure

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file where the entire webpage is constructed.
- `README.md`: You are currently reading this file, which provides an overview of the project and its structure.

## HTML Structure

### Header

The header section represents the top part of the webpage. It includes a logo image and a block of three links.

### Banner

The banner section comes after the header. It consists of a main element with a section inside. The section contains two blocks:
1. The first block includes a heading, a text element, and a button.
2. The second block contains four sub-blocks, each with an image, a heading, and a text.

### Quote

Following the banner, we have the quote section. It is contained within the main element. The quote section comprises a block with an image and another block with a quote, an author quote, and a text.

### Videos

The videos section is located after the quote section. It begins with a heading and contains a block with four video blocks. Each video block includes an image, a heading, a text, an author block with an image and a heading, and a rating block consisting of a set of star images and a text.

### Membership

The membership section appears after the videos section. It contains an heading and a block with four item blocks. Each item block consists of an image, a heading, a text, and a button.

### FAQ

The FAQ section comes after the membership section. It includes a section with two rows, each row containing two item blocks. Each item block consists of a heading and a text.

### Footer

The footer is the final section of the webpage. It is located outside of the main element. The footer includes a global block for centering the footer content. Inside the global block, there is a row block with an image and a block containing images with links and a text.

## Conclusion

This README provides a high-level overview of the HTML structure for the project. It helps to understand the organization of the various sections in the webpage, making it easier to implement the structure accordingly.
